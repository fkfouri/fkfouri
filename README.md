ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the Data, how to understand it, how to extract knowledge from it, how to construct optimized pipelines, how to aggregate value in a business, how to build a future base on data driven.

I have a vision that the I.T. (Information Techonology) means to use all technologies needs to provide and support the 
knowledge hierarchy like a jorney to elevate the comprehension since data until to achieve the wisdom. If the techonology isn't used fot this maybe it is a Entertainment Techonology (E.T.).
